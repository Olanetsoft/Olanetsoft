<h3 align="center"> Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm <B>IDRIS</B></h3>
<hr>

I am a Software Developer, Technical Writer, and Speaker with extensive experience in the entire project life cycle, from concept to implementation to integration. I am an expert at problem-solving, technical leadership, communications, and presentations.

I enjoy working in teams, partnering, and pair programming and I have extensive professional experience in the Information Technology industry, with over 3 years of building and developing in which I provide clear strategic guidance through multiple projects. 


Aside slapping my keyboard till something magical emerge, i write articles [Here](https://blog.idrisolubisi.com "My Blog") and also contribute to open source.
